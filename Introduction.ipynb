    "### Model Settings\n",
    "Use these two settings to control the length of your output:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Length:** This is the max number of tokens that can be generated in the response. The higher the limit, the more likely the generated response is to veer off into unexpected territory. Consider shortening the output length for a more predictable response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add stop sequence:** This tells the model when to stop generating content. For example, prompting the model with “The quick brown fox jumps over the ” and entering a full stop (.) for the stop sequence will tell the model to stop generating text once it reaches the end of the first sentence, regardless of the output length limit - in this case, the output will likely be \"lazy dog.\" Use this where you have a couple of examples, but would like the output to follow a certain pattern. For example, you can tell the model to generate lists that have no more than 10 items by adding \"11\" as a stop sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### These three settings will help you tweak how random the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temperature:** Helps adjust how creative or conservative the model should be. It adjusts the probabilities of the predicted words, on a scale between 0 and 1. Lower temperatures (<0.5) are good for prompts that require higher likelihood of accuracy - a temperature of 0 is deterministic, where the probability of the most likely outcome (token) is 1, and the rest are 0. Use a higher temperature (>0.5) to generate more creative, \"fun\" results. We will use 0.1 as a standard best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**topK:** Tells the model to pick the next token from the top k tokens in its list, sorted by probability. A topK value of 40 tells the model to pick from the top 40 tokens, and exclude the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**topP:** Randomly samples from the top tokens based on the sum of their probabilities. In MakerSuite, the default topP is 0.95, meaning the model will pick from tokens whose probabilities add up to 95%, and exclude the bottom 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can play around with these settings depending on your needs and use case."

    "id": "6d7870ff75cc"
   },
   "source": [
    "**Emphasis through prompting:**\n",
    "Emphasis through Capitalization: Use capitalization to stress important points or instructions. This can help guide the model's responses and maintain a certain focus. For instance, \"Remember to KEEP DETAILS CONFIDENTIAL\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extreme Emphasis:**\n",
    "You can use exaggerations or hyperbolic language to amplify the importance of your prompt or instructions. For instance, instead of saying \"Make sure it's clear,\" you might say, \"Your explanation should be as clear as a summer's day, absolutely impossible to misinterpret. Every single word must ooze clarity!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emphasis through Repetition:**\n",
    "Reiteration of key phrases or ideas can effectively guide the AI model's responses. For example, \"remember to be creative... keep in mind to be creative... don't forget to be creative...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt modularization:**\n",
    "Modularize instruction: Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts, facilitating more interactive and manageable conversations. Ex: Instead of having many instructions in 1 prompt, modularize the prompts and have 1 prompt per instruction. Then based on the user’s  input, you can choose which prompt to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt chaining:**\n",
    "This is a technique to complete complex tasks by chaining together multiple prompts. The output of one prompt is used as the input for the next prompt, and so on. For example, first convert the file format to csv, then do operation x, then do operation y on the new dataset and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregation technique:**\n",
    "This is a technique to perform certain tasks on specific portions of the data and then aggregate them all to produce the final output. Ex: Do operation x on the first part of the data, do operation y on the rest of the data and aggregate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trial and error:\n",
    "**Iterative prompting:**\n",
    "Technique where prompts are continuously refined and adjusted to enhance clarity, effectiveness, and quality when working with large language models; by progressively adapting prompts based on feedback, it ensures that responses meet desired criteria; this is especially useful in application development and content generation, optimizing interaction between human input and machine learning models for better outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starting over:**\n",
    "Sometimes, when a prompt is not working well, and some iterations of it are not doing it, start from scratch with a different prompt, see which sections from the previous prompt help, which don’t - filter out the sections which “work” (make the model behave the way you want) and add to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modular testing:**\n",
    "When a prompt is not working, split the task into many sub tasks and run the portion of the prompt that achieves a given sub-task. This will help you identify where it is not working and fix the prompt accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement techniques:\n",
    "**Redundancy Technique:**\n",
    "Similar to the \"Capitalize vs Repeat\" technique, use synonyms or different phraseologies for the same instruction to reinforce the direction of the prompt. Ex: Instead of saying ‘make sure to..’ you say the same thing many times by replacing ‘make sure’ with ‘ensure’, ‘guarantee’, ‘verify’..  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Instructions:**\n",
    "Explicitly mention what you don't want in the response. This is useful when the model tends to produce certain unwanted outputs for specific prompts. Ex: ‘Don’t output any sources.’\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-reference:**\n",
    "Use the AI's self-awareness to your advantage by instructing it to evaluate or check its own responses before producing them. For example, \"Make sure your response is concise and does not include unnecessary details\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt formatting techniques:\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "Having a structured prompt helps the model better understand the task. Start by defining its role. Ex: “Your role is to read the input data and structure it in the following format” Then tell it what the input data is, then tell it what the desired format is, then tell it how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use constraints:**\n",
    "Constraints can be used to limit the scope of the model's output. For example, you could constrain the model to generate a line that is no longer than 10 words long or not to output any other data than the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use delimiters:**\n",
    "Delimiters in prompt engineering provide clear distinctions within your text, effectively separating instructions from content. This practice helps prevent misunderstandings, allows you greater control over AI responses, and ensures consistent results, even when handling complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous:\n",
    "**Prioritization:**\n",
    "Clearly communicate to the AI model what content or information is most critical. This approach helps in guiding the AI's focus and ensures the most important topics or issues are addressed accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use examples:**\n",
    "Providing examples of the desired output can also be helpful. This can help the model to understand what you are looking for and to generate more accurate results. Sometimes you can describe what you want so well that you won’t need an example, but it only helps the model to give it more information as long as you’re operating below the context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preferred Output Format:**\n",
    "Specify your desired output format. If a CSV format is more useful than plain text, instruct the AI model to produce the output in that format from the outset. This strategy can save time and effort on manual conversions later.\n",
    "We have seen that the model processes csv and json format better than it does with txt files.\n",
    "Prompting it to first convert the txt file to csv or json yields a better result.\n",
    "Writing your prompt in json format or requesting the output to be in json or csv format yield more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use a prompt library:**\n",
    "There are a number of online libraries that contain pre-made prompts that can be used for a variety of tasks. We have a prompt library in Vertex AI → Generative AI studio → Language → prompt examples. This can be a helpful resource if you’d like a starting point or have a very common task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nice words:**\n",
    "Using words like ‘please’, ‘great job!’, ‘you are the best!’ … increases the model’s compliance rate. This increases the ‘confidence level’ of the model and it positively reinforces the model’s behavior which tends to increase accuracy for simple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lastly and most important: Be Creative:**\n",
    "This isn’t even the tip of the iceberg - the more creative you are, the better you can make the model behave the way you want. For example, instead of saying \"provide deep insights,\" you can write: “Ensure that you provide deep insights... Provide very very deep insights. I told you to give deep insights!!!!! Do not write anything that is not deeply insightful! Make sure to check this requirement is 100% met every time you respond. It’s better that you don’t return anything than returning something that’s not very very insightful!!!”. If you have a long prompt, you may also consider adding the same statement in different places - this helps the model prioritize that task (aka sandwich technique).\n",
